# 📘 Student Mental Health Analysis Project

A comprehensive data-driven study exploring university students’ mental well-being using Python, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), visual analytics, and an interactive dashboard.  

This project aims to uncover the academic, lifestyle, emotional, and social factors that significantly influence student anxiety, depression, stress levels, and overall mental health.

# 🎯 Project Goals

The main objectives of this project are:

- Understand the root causes of stress, anxiety, and depression among students.
- Study the relationship between academic workload and mental well-being.
- Explore how lifestyle habits (sleep, study hours, social interaction) affect mental health.
- Identify high-risk factors using data visualization and correlation analysis.
- Build an interactive dashboard to allow users to explore patterns easily.
- Provide insights that universities can use to support students more effectively.

# 🧠 Dataset Description

The dataset consists of **87 student records** and **21 well-defined features** that collectively represent a broad spectrum of academic, emotional, lifestyle, and social factors influencing student mental health. Each feature contributes uniquely to understanding how students cope with academic demands, personal challenges, and environmental conditions within their universities.

### 🔹 Demographic Features  
These attributes help establish the basic characteristics of each student:
- **gender** – Biological gender, which might influence stress and emotional responses.  
- **age** – Age differences often reflect variations in maturity, study habits, and stress tolerance.  
- **university** – Institutional environment may affect academic pressure and support services.

### 🔹 Academic Features  
These columns describe the student’s academic context and workload:
- **degree_level** – Indicates whether the student is an undergraduate or postgraduate.  
- **degree_major** – Field of study (e.g., Computer Science, IT, Management), which may relate to workload intensity.  
- **academic_year** – Year of study, important because freshmen and seniors face different challenges.  
- **cgpa** – Indicator of academic performance, often associated with stress and self-expectations.  
- **academic_workload** – Measures the amount of assignments, exams, and projects.  
- **academic_pressure** – Reflects stress levels caused by academic expectations, deadlines, and competitiveness.

### 🔹 Mental-Health Indicators  
These features are crucial for detecting psychological distress:
- **stress** – Self-reported stress levels.  
- **anxiety** – Measures general anxiety tendencies and intensity.  
- **depression** – Indicates emotional well-being and mood health.  
- **isolation** – Level of social withdrawal or loneliness.  
- **emotional_stability** – Stability of mood, reactions, and emotional control.  
- **mental_wellbeing** – General mental-health status based on multiple behavioral indicators.

### 🔹 Lifestyle & Social Variables  
Lifestyle habits strongly influence mental health, making these features essential:
- **average_sleep** – Total hours of sleep per night; major factor in anxiety and focus.  
- **sleep_quality** – How restful or disrupted the sleep cycle is.  
- **study_hours** – Average daily study time, often correlating with stress or performance.  
- **motivation** – Student’s drive and consistency toward academic goals.  
- **social_interaction** – Frequency and strength of social connections; protective factor against isolation.  
- **financial_concerns** – Measures financial stress, which commonly contributes to mental-health challenges.

## 📌 Why This Dataset Matters

This dataset is valuable for several reasons:

### ✔ 1. **Comprehensive Coverage of Student Life**
It integrates academic metrics, emotional indicators, lifestyle habits, and social variables—allowing a holistic view of student well-being rather than focusing on isolated factors.

### ✔ 2. **Supports Data-Driven Mental Health Research**
Mental-health issues among students are rising globally, and this dataset enables the identification of patterns such as:
- the impact of academic pressure  
- the relationship between sleep deprivation and mental distress  
- how financial stress contributes to anxiety and depression  

### ✔ 3. **Enables Early Detection of High-Risk Groups**
By analyzing correlations and trends, researchers can determine:
- which students are most vulnerable  
- how lifestyle habits modify risk  
- which interventions can be effective  

### ✔ 4. **Useful for Universities & Policy Makers**
Insights from this dataset can help universities design:
- better counseling programs  
- balanced course workloads  
- financial support initiatives  
- awareness campaigns to promote mental well-being  

### ✔ 5. **Ideal for EDA, ML, and Dashboard Projects**
Because the dataset is small, clean, and well-structured, it is perfect for:
- exploratory data analysis  
- interactive dashboards  
- machine learning classification tasks  
- educational workshops and portfolio projects
